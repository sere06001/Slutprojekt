IF HAVE TIME LEFT OVER:
Moving levels
Hittable objects that bounce ball back

1. Add level winning/losing conditions, should win when all 25 red objects have been hit but do not project win screen until ballmanager.balls is empty (no active balls), 
ONLY save score if level is won instead of when ballmanager.balls is empty (that was just for testing)
